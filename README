I had a long battle with the pipes not working, until I realized I had a backwards
comparison and they were never being created. After that, everything worked great.

Strengths: Works with single commands, commands with single pipe, commands with two
or more pipes, commands with many pipes and a lot of data. Commands can have any number of
trailing spaces.

Weaknesses: Doesn't work with the supplied example command with many pipes and a
lot of data, but neither does my bash. By modifying the arguments that create errors,
it works. Shell still handles errors as expected, making it the fault of an incorrect
command. Code could be more efficient (having two cases, one with pipes and one without,
seems wasteful)
